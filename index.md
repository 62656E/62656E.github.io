## About Me

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in 2020, graduating with a first-class degree. My dissertation project centred on the effect of copper ions on the coagulation of blood.

Following this, I completed my Masters degree in Applied Biosciences at ARU, obtaining a merit, with a final project on the role of *Musca domestica* as antimicrobial resistance gene transmission vectors.

I am now, after a brief interlude working within student services, completing my PhD on the role of circadian gene variants in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, with Drs Tim Hearn, Krithika Sundararaman and Clett Erridge at ARU.
