# Benjamin Travis

Chronobiology PhD Researcher | Anglia Ruskin University (Cambridge)

## About Me

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in 2020, graduating with a first-class degree. My dissertation project centred on the effect of copper ions on the coagulation of blood.

Following this, I completed my Masters degree in Applied Biosciences at ARU, obtaining a merit, with a final project on the role of *Musca domestica* as antimicrobial resistance gene transmission vectors.

I am now, after a brief interlude working within student services, completing my PhD on the role of circadian gene variants in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, with Drs Tim Hearn, Krithika Sundararaman and Clett Erridge at ARU.

## Research

My current research focuses on the role of circadian gene variants in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. I am particularly interested in how these genetic factors interact with environmental influences to affect disease onset and progression.
I am also exploring the potential for circadian rhythm modulation as a therapeutic strategy in epilepsy management. This research aims to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and identify novel targets for intervention.
